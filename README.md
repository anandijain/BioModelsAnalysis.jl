# BioModelsAnalysis.jl

analyzing the structure of biomodels in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/

todo store a zip of all biomodel ODEs for tests to avoid having to download them sequentially every time (and avoid grabbing index)

if you want a quick glance at the ODE models you can look at `data/biomodels_metadata_joined.csv`

todo ship odes index json as part of the artifacts made by BioModelsLoader
